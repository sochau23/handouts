A warm front was pushing through West Virginia at the time, triggering showers and rare early morning January thunderstorms.  Predawn temperatures were in the 40s.  Sensors from the National Lightning Detection Network indicated a few cloud to ground strikes in the vicinity.  A strong positively charge bolt occurred around 0626E, followed a few seconds later by a minor seismic event.  Local residents reported that their houses shook.  The U.S. Geological Survey Advanced National Seismic System sensor at Mont Chateau along Cheat Lake near Morgantown, recorded the event most clearly.  The initial underground blast may have killed one coal miner. Twelve other miners were trapped in the mine after the explosion.  Eleven of those miners were likely asphyxiated by carbon monoxide, as they waited to be rescued.  One of the younger miners survived more than 36 hours in the mine, and was hospitalized.    Lightning was being investigated as the most likely cause of the initial ignition.  If so, then 12 deaths can be indirectly attributed to lightning.  However, as of early February, the investigation was still ongoing, and the final determination of the cause had not been determined.There have been cases in the past, where lightning energy was transferred into underground coal mines, and caused seals from worked out areas to blow.",NA,PDS
